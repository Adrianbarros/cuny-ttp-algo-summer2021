/**
 * Problem Statement: 
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
 * You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t
 * count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array. The flag of the Netherlands
 * consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also
 * consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
 * 
 * Example:
 * { 1, 0, 2, 1, 0 };
 * [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
 * [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
 * [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]
 * [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
 * sorted = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2};
 * 
 * Genereal idea:
 * The idea is to move the 0s to the left and the 2s to the right.
 * 
 * Edge cases:
 * empty array/null -> return
 * 
 * create a swap method
 * ---
 * initialize left pointer to 0
 * initialize right pointer to arr.length - 1
 * for loop from 0 until the index less than or equal to the right (i.e. the index is at the 2s, no more swapping is needed):
 *   if arr[i] is 0:
 *     swap arr[i] with arr[left]
 *     increment the left pointer
 *   if arr[i] is 2:
 *     swap arr[i] with arr[right]
 *     decrement the right pointer
 *     decrement the current index (we decrement the index because we might have a 0 now that needs to be swapped)
 *   in the case of arr[i] is 1, we do nothing (the for loop increments the index)
 * 
 * Runtime:
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
